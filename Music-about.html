          O'Connell was born in Los Angeles, California, on December 18, 2001. She is the daughter of teacher, actress, and screenwriter Maggie Baird, and construction worker Patrick O'Connell, who worked part-time as an actor, appearing in films like Iron Man (2008). Both her parents are amateur musicians. She is of Irish and Scottish descent. The singer's middle name, Eilish, was originally meant to be her first name, while Pirate (proposed by her brother Finneas, four years her senior) was to be her middle name. She was conceived via in vitro fertilization. She was raised in Los Angeles' Highland Park neighborhood.

While she was homeschooled, her mother taught her and Finneas the basics of songwriting. O'Connell and her brother had worked together on some music, while he had been writing and producing his own songs and performing with his band. O'Connell said her brother and her mother inspired her to get into music. Their parents encouraged the siblings to express themselves and explore whatever they wanted, including art, dancing and acting. O'Connell wrote her first "real" song at age 11 for her mother's songwriting class. The song is about the zombie apocalypse, inspired by the television series The Walking Dead from which she took script lines and episode titles that she added to the song as part of the assignment. O'Connell had gone on some acting auditions, which she disliked; however, she enjoyed recording background dialogue for crowd scenes and worked on the films Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Ramona and Beezus, and the X-Men series. She performed at talent shows and joined the Los Angeles Children's Chorus at age eight.

          Eilish is a regular advocate on social media for animal rights and veganism, and among others has criticised the dairy, wool, and mink fur industries. In 2019 she won a PETA "Best Voice for Animals" award for her activism.

In 2020, Eilish has also gotten involved in supporting United States voting rights. Eilish suggested that her fans pick a group working to register voters to support. In August 2020, Eilish performed at the 2020 Democratic National Convention, and announced her endorsement of Joe Biden's presidential campaign.
